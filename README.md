## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

A friend on Frontend Mentor and LinkedIn encouraged me to return to the basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)...and so I did. What really stuck out to me was how much I forgot about basic JavaScript after having used React and JSX so regularly for the last 3 months. Also, due to regular use of React, I forgot how to write my relative paths so that GitHub Pages and VS Code could consume them with vanilla HTML/CSS.

Here is an example:

```html
<script src="./script.js"></script>
```

```css
.background {
  background-image: url("./images/background-pattern-desktop.svg");
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue doing projects using pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript to refresh my knowledge on the basics and hopefully find a few new things along the way.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is a great reference site which helped me remember some of the required syntax and generalities surrounding JavaScript.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an excellent resource for finding answers to precise questions. I used during this challenge to check how to fix my relative paths during deployment.
